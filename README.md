To start:

1. `npm install`
2. `grunt` to compile css/js
3. `npm start` to spin up the express server

You'll need to have a valid api source for it to all work though. Copy `env.sample.js` to `env.js` and fill in a API source. I'm using WordPress + [Wordpress JSON API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/) to serve up my content.
